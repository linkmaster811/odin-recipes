    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Keep the kids happy with these wallet-friendly cheeseburgers - ready in just 35 minutes and you can freeze leftovers</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg minced beef</li>
        <li>300g breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>140g Mature cheddar, grated</li>
        <li>4 tbsp WOrcestershire sauce</li>
        <li> 1 small bunch parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crumble the mince in a large bowl, then tip in the breadcrumbs, cheese, Worcestershire sauce, parsley and eggs with 1 tsp ground pepper and 1-2 tsp salt. Mix with your hands to combine everything thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Shape the mix into 12 burgers. Chill until ready to cook for up to 24 hrs. Or freeze for up to 3 months. Just stack between squares of baking parchment to stop the burgers sticking together, then wrap well. Defrost overnight in the fridge before cooking.</li>
        <li>To cook the burgers, heat grill to high. Grill burgers for 6-8 mins on each side until cooked through. Meanwhile, warm as many buns as you need in a foil-covered tray below the grilling burgers. Let everyone assemble their own, served with their favourite accompaniments.</li>
    </ol>
